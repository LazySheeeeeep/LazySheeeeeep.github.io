I'm a first-year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/) at [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)](https://hkust.edu.hk/), advised by [Prof. Long Chen](https://zjuchenlong.github.io/). My research focuses on video generation, with particular interests in efficient generation and high-quality synthesis.

I received my Bachelor's degree in 2025 from the [School of Information Science and Technology](https://sist.ustc.edu.cn/), [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](https://www.ustc.edu.cn/), majoring in Artificial Intelligence.
