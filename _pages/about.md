I'm a forth year undergraduate student from [School of Information Science and Technology](https://sist.ustc.edu.cn/), [University of Science and Technology of China, USTC](https://www.ustc.edu.cn/). My major is Atificial Intelligence and my research interest includes computer vision, Multimodal Model and Vision Large Model.

I'm delighted to share that I've received an offer to pursue a PhD in [Department of CSE](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/), [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, HKUST](https://hkust.edu.hk/). I was advised by [Prof. Jiaya Jia](https://jiaya.me/home). I look forward to officially starting my doctoral journey in the fall of 2025.
